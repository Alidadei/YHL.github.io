## Educational Experience
======================================

###   2015-2018  ||   Junior High School of Shenzhen Foreign Language School **as** Publicity Member
###   2018-2021  ||   Senior High School of Shenzhen Foreign Language School **as** Publicity Committee Member
###   2021-present ||   Ocean University of China || School Calligraphy Association Officer, Self-improvement Club Volunteer

## Research Projects
======================================
### 2022.11-2023.11   ||                   校级大创：基于 stm32 的智能桌面系统   ||              负责人

大二学年，我**主持了**一项名为“基于 stm32 的智能桌面系统”的校级大创。该项目旨在针对现代人的学习办公需求和健康问题设计一种**多功能人机交互书桌系统**。 **总体上，** 我负责了整个项目的立项、中期答辩和结项总结，以及整体开发进度的统筹安排。**硬件上**，我组织组员共同讨论并选取了STM32F407主控、LD3320语音识别芯片和TFTLCD电阻触控屏进行开发。**软件上**，我用Keil C编写了整体的代码控制框架，同时完成了语音控制、人体感应和手机锁功能的开发，编程过程中我**利用哈希思想和函数指针来优化系统语音控制的轮询过程**，大大降低了代码的时间复杂度。最终，我们进行了实物测试，系统的自动亮度调节、触控屏控制和语音控制等功能皆达到预期，表现出良好的鲁棒性和实用性。这一段经历锻炼了我的嵌入式编程开发能力和组织协调能力，同时也是我将所学化为所用的一次实践!

### 2022.11-2023.11 || School-level Innovation Project: Intelligent Desktop System Based on STM32 || Project Leader

During my sophomore year, I **led** a school-level innovation project titled "Intelligent Desktop System Based on STM32." The project aimed to design a **multifunctional human-computer interaction desk system** tailored to the learning & office needs, as well as health concerns of modern individuals. **Overall,** I was responsible for the project's initiation, mid-term defense, final summary, and the coordination of the overall development schedule. **In terms of hardware,** I organized several team discussions through which we decided to choose STM32F407 main controller, LD3320 voice recognition chip, and TFTLCD resistive touch screen for development. **On the software side,** I wrote the overall code control framework using Keil C and also completed the development of voice control, body sensing and mobile phone lock functions. During the programming process, I **employed hash thinking and function pointers to optimize the system's voice control polling process,** significantly reducing the code's time complexity. Ultimately, we conducted a physical testing, and the functions of our system all met our expectations, demonstrating good robustness and practicality. This experience honed my skills in embedded programming and project coordination. It was a practice for me to put what I've learnt into practice!

### 2023.8-2024.8  ||   “智能自主系统”课题组实习     ||    		核心成员

大三伊始，我怀着对强化学习和大语言模型的研究兴趣，主动联系了本校李光亮老师并加入了他的 **“智能自主系统”** 课题组。我在老师的指导下，参与了有关 **“结合大语言模型和强化学习的机器人学习方法”** 文献调研，并对相关研究做出了归纳和总结，目前根据我的调研**已初步形成了一篇综述文章**。同时，我参与了 **“基于大语言模型的社交机器人Haru的自主行为学习方法”的科研项目**，自主学习和完成了ubuntu系统ROS实验环境的装配，并在gazebo平台上进行了仿真实验。这段经历充分锻炼了我的前沿文献调研能力和动手实践能力，为我未来的科研工作打下了坚实基础。

### 2023.8-2024.8 || "Intelligent Autonomous Systems" Research Group Internship || Core Member

At the beginning of my junior year, driven by a research interest in Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models, I contacted Professor Li on my own initiative and joined his **"Intelligent Autonomous Systems"** research group. Under the guidance of him, I engaged in a literature research on **"Robot Learning Methods Combining Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning"**, and summarized the relevant studies, which have led to the preliminary formation of a review article. Concurrently, I participated in the research project **"Autonomous Behavioral Learning Methods for Social Robot Haru Based on Large Language Models"**, independently learning and setting up the ROS experimental environment on the Ubuntu system, and conducting simulation experiments on the Gazebo platform. This experience has thoroughly honed my ability to research cutting-edge literature and largely trained my practical skills, laying a solid foundation for my future scientific research work.
